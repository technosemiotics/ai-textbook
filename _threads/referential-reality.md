# the referential reality problem


**The referential reality of synthetic content...**

...is constructed and determined by a (human) 'judge' comparing their expectations to the outcome (output).

If the **result meets expectations** --> human decision:
- stated facts seem correct
- style is satisfactory
- the result is fine
- "the text seems a satisfactory reflection about external reality"
- we can publish it

If the **result is lacking** --> human decision:

- stated facts are insufficient or inconsistent
- statements are false or nonsensical
- the text "sounds weird"
- we cannot publish it like it is
